Requirements:
	- Python 3, including the Python libraries
	Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and
	Matplotlib
	- Jupyter Notebook

Before running the code, download the biking data from

   https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn ,

store them in the same directory as analysis.py.

The program may be run by calling

./model.py

For a deeper analysis, the Jupyter Notebook may be run:
